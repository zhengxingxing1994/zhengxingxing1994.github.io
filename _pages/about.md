Hey there! I'm Liangliang, currently working as a software engineer in the Netherlands, I've got a  background in data science that still fuels my passion for `AI`, `data analysis`, `data visualization`, and `robotics` etc. Lately, I've been diving into the fascinating realm of large-scale `distributed systems` and their designs.

I've migrated my old [Blog](https://zhengliangliang.wordpress.com/) now here, so some of the old posts have code highlighting/formatting or formula `LaTeX` rendering issue, which would be adjusted soon...
