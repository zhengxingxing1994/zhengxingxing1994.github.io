<h2 id="introduction-motivation-of-this-blog-">Introduction: Motivation of this blog <a name="motivation"></a>
</h2>

<p>Last week, I had a thought-provoking discussion with my colleagues. The topic of our conversation? Supplements. What intrigued me was that, just like many of my peers, I too have ventured into the world of supplements because of David Sinclair and various of health-related podcasts like Huberman lab. While the reasons taking supplements is easy for me: looking to combat inflammation. For my colleague, this could be boost performance when working out.</p>

<p>A pill that promises health improvements, anti-aging effects, but to be honest I had very limited knowledge of those small pills I’m taking, I yearn for comprehension.What exactly are these supplements composed of at a molecular level? How do these minuscule pills exert their influence within our bodies biologically? Moreover, is there an optimal approach to taking these supplements to maximize their potential benefits for our health and well-being?</p>

<p>Over the past few days, I’ve immersed myself into articles, research papers, and scientific literature. My aim was clear: to understand these tiny capsules that promise health. In the sections to come, I included 10 different supplements and introduced them each from the very essence of these their chemical identities, their categorizations, their mechanisms of action with the academic evidence. In the end a suggest dose for those supplements was given.</p>

<h3 id="resveratrol-">Resveratrol <a name="Resveratrol"></a>
</h3>

<p>Resveratrol (RV) is a potent polyphenolic compound found in a variety of fruits and vegetables, including grapes, skin of peanuts, mulberries, blueberries, bilberries, soybeans, pomegranates, cranberries, soy, dark chocolate, pistachios. It possesses a distinct chemical structure, primarily composed of two aromatic rings connected by a methylene bridge. Biologically when you take resveratorl, it is rapidly metabolized by phase II enzymes in the intestine and liver. The RV’s <strong>low solubility</strong>(&lt; 0.05mg/ml) in water is caused by its enzymatic structure, which might affect its consumption.<a href="#1">[1]</a></p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/al-folio/images/2023/11/2880px-Cis_and_trans_resveratrol_notext%20copy.svg.png" alt="Cis_and_trans_resveratrol" width="350" height="100">
</p>

<p>Resveratrol occurs naturally in two forms: trans and cis isomers, with the trans-isomer being the more commonly associated with health benefits. It is typically a white powder extracted using methanol, characterized by a melting point between 253°C and 255°C, and has a relatively low molecular weight of 228.25.<a href="#1">[1]</a> While trans-resveratrol is the form primarily studied for its potential health advantages, cis-resveratrol is less prevalent and is typically produced synthetically rather than being the predominant form found in natural sources. The variation in the spatial arrangement of atoms around the double bond results in differences in the chemical and biological properties of these two isomers. Trans-resveratrol is generally considered the more biologically active and bioavailable form, making it the focal point of most research on the potential health benefits of resveratrol.</p>

<h4 id="mechanisms-of-action">Mechanisms of action</h4>
<p>It has been discovered that RV has many potential health benefits like antioxidant , cardioprotective, neurological, anti-inflammatory, antiplatelet, blood glucose-lowering, and anticancer activities.<a href="#1">[1]</a> In another famous experiments in nonhuman primates carried out by Laboratory of Cardiovascular Science, resveratrol has been found to prevent high fat/sucrose (HFS) diet-induced central arterial wall inflammation and stiffening.<a href="#2">[2]</a> Below is a simplified summary of its actions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>SIRT1/3 Activation:</strong> Resveratrol activates SIRT1 and SIRT3 enzymes (SIRT1 and SIRT3 is one of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirtuin" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Sirtuin</a>, which are types of proteins involved in metabolic regulation, inflammation), Sirt1 has been implicated in many vital processes, such as DNA repair, cell survival, gluconeogenesis, muscle cell differentiation, cell-cycle regulation, lipid metabolism, fat mobilization and insulin sensitivity. <a href="#3">[3]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Neuroprotective Effects:</strong> It reduces <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoplasmic_reticulum" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">endoplasmic reticulum</a> (ER) stress, inhibits carbonyl protein activity, and supports factors associated with brain health.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Cardiometabolic Benefits:</strong> Resveratrol improves mitochondrial (The mitochondria are like little workers in a factory. They take the food you eat, use the oxygen you breathe, and create energy for your body) respiratory activity in the heart, increases adenosine monophosphate kinase (p-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMP-activated_protein_kinase" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AMPK</a>) levels (AMPK acts as a sensor of cellular energy status and helps regulate various metabolic processes to ensure the cell has enough energy to function), and boosts <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOD2" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">SOD2</a> (a family of enzymes that play a crucial role in protecting cells from damage caused by free radicals) levels, promoting cardiovascular health.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Inflammation Regulation:</strong> Resveratrol reduces inflammatory parameters, including interleukin-6 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">IL-6</a> (IL-6 involved in promoting inflammation, regulating immune cell activity) and Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factor" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">TNF-α</a>, which plays a significant role in managing oxidative stress.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Anti-Cancer Properties:</strong> Resveratrol inhibits the production of NADPH oxidase <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NADPH_oxidase" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">NOX</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloperoxidase" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">myeloperoxidase</a>, showing potential anti-cancer effects.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Neurological Health:</strong> Resveratrol inhibits Nitric oxide synthase <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide_synthase" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">iNOS</a> production, protects against lipid peroxidation, and has potential therapeutic effects for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) by promoting amyloid precursor protein cleavage and overcoming oxidative stress.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Reproductive System Benefits:</strong> Resveratrol improves sperm mobility, increases zinc concentration, and counteracts prooxidative effects in the reproductive system.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Intestinal Health:</strong> Resveratrol reduces markers like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_8" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">IL-8</a>, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">VEGF</a> (VEGF’s normal function is to create new blood vessels, but overexpression of VEGF can cause vascular disease), and Reactive oxygen species <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_oxygen_species" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ROS</a> (ROS are like energetic troublemakers in your body that, when there are too many of them, can create a bit of chaos and cause damage to your cells), indicating a role in managing intestinal disorders. <a href="#4">[4]</a></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The figure below shows the general benefits of resveratrol.</p>

<h3 id="nmn-">NMN <a name="NMN"></a>
</h3>

<p>Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_mononucleotide" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">NMN</a>). In humans, several enzymes use NMN to generate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">NADH</a>). (NAD+ (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide) is a crucial coenzyme in cells that plays a fundamental role in various biological processes, you can think of it as coal for energy production, NAD+ was found gradually declining during aging.<a href="#6">[6]</a>) NMN can be found in fruits and vegetables such as broccoli, cabbage, cucumber and avocado at a concentration of about 1 mg per 100g. In mammals most NMN is synthesized from vitamin B3 in the form of nicotinamide. <a href="#5">[5]</a></p>

</p>

<p>NMN consists of three main components: a nicotinamide group, a ribose sugar, and a phosphate group. The nicotinamide group is connected to the ribose unit, and the phosphate group is attached to the ribose, forming the complete NMN molecule. In the human body, it can be found in placenta tissue and body fluids such as blood and urine. <a href="#7">[7]</a></p>

<p><strong>NAD+ Decline During Aging:</strong></p>

<p>Aging is naturally associated with a decline in NAD+ levels.
Enzymes like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirtuin" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">sirtuins</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD38" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">CD38</a>/CD157, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procyclin" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PARP</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tankyrase" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">TNKS</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BST1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">BST</a> contribute to NAD+ consumption during aging. <a href="#7">[7]</a> Chronic inflammation and oxidative stress hinder NAD+ biosynthesis. Reduced NAD+ levels lead to interruptions in cellular communication and mitochondrial dysfunction, contributing to age-related complications.</p>

<p><strong>Why NMN Could Work as a Solution:</strong></p>

<p>NMN (Nicotinamide Mononucleotide) is an intermediate compound in the NAD+ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosynthesis" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">biosynthesis</a> (simple compounds are modified, converted into other compounds) pathway. Administering NMN can compensate for the decline in NAD+ levels during aging. NMN supplementation may activate SIRT1, a protein associated with anti-aging effects.
Studies suggest NMN as a potential solution to restore NAD+ levels and counteract aging effects. The effect could be summarized by the figure <a href="#7">[7]</a> shown below</p>

<h4 id="ubiquinol-">Ubiquinol <a name="Ubiquinol"></a>
</h4>
<p>The term “ubiquinol” derives from “ubiquitous,” signifying its widespread presence. Ubiquinol is an electron-rich (reduced) form of coenzyme Q (ubiquinone), aka CoQ10. In 1957, Professor Frederick Crane and colleagues discovered CoQ10 from beef heart mitochondria at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Enzyme Institute.6 R.A. Morton, from the United Kingdom, isolated the compound in rat liver just after Dr. Crane’s discovery. It was Morton who named the compound ubiquinone, meaning ubiquitous quinone or one that “exists everywhere.”. In 1962, Peter D. Mitchell, PhD from University of Edinburgh determined how CoQ10 produces energy at the cellular level and in 1978 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry based on his discovery. Q10 normally could be found in Fish, Calf’s Liver (and other organ meats), Germ portion of whole grains in nature. <a href="#8">[8]</a></p>

<p>CoQ10, also known as ubiquinone, is a necessary component of cell respiration and ATP production. Ubiquinone is a fat soluble substance used to form ubiquinol, the fully reduced form of ubiquinone and potent antioxidant. <a href="#8">[8]</a></p>

<p><strong>Chemical Structure of CoQ10</strong>: The most common form in humans is Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10 or ubiquinone-10). CoQ10 is a 1,4-benzoquinone, where the “Q” refers to the quinone chemical group, and “10” signifies the number of isoprenyl chemical subunits in its tail. (Ubiquinone Tail Variability: In natural ubiquinones, there can be from six to ten subunits in the tail. The specific variant, ubiquinone-10, is predominantly found in humans.)</p>

</p>

<h4 id="mechanisms-of-action-2">Mechanisms of action</h4>

<p>Role in Energy Production: CoQ10 is a family of fat-soluble substances, resembling vitamins, and is present in all respiring eukaryotic cells, primarily in the mitochondria.</p>

<p>Mitochondrial Function: As a vital component of the electron transport chain, CoQ10 participates in aerobic cellular respiration, a process that generates energy in the form of ATP.</p>

<p>Energy Generation: A substantial 95% of the human body’s energy is generated through aerobic cellular respiration, highlighting the significance of CoQ10.</p>

<p>Organ-Specific Concentrations: Organs with high energy demands, such as the heart, liver, and kidney, exhibit the highest concentrations of CoQ10, emphasizing its critical role in meeting the energy requirements of these vital organs.</p>

<p>The effect of Ubiquinol is much better than that of ordinary Q10 (ubiquinone), and currently the only supplier of Ubiquinol on the market is <strong>Kaneka</strong> from Japan. <a href="#8">[8]</a></p>

<p>Moreover, CoQ10 can increase the production of key antioxidants such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide_dismutase" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">superoxide dismutase</a>, an enzyme capable of reducing vascular oxidative stress in hypertensive patients. <a href="#9">[9]</a> CoQ10 reduces levels of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_peroxidation" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">lipid peroxidation</a> via the reduction of pro-oxidative compounds. <a href="#10">[10]</a> So peroxidation is a chain reaction commonly found in polyunsaturated fatty acids, and its products may be carcinogenic and mutagenic. Since lipids are components of cell membranes, lipid peroxidation may have disastrous consequences if it’s out of control inside body.</p>

</p>

<p>The mechanism of action of Astaxanthin (ASX) involves its multifaceted impact on cellular and molecular processes, particularly in mitigating skin aging.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
<strong>Antioxidant and Anti-Inflammatory Properties:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>ASX acts as a potent antioxidant, capturing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singlet_oxygen" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">singlet oxygen</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">radicals</a> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermis" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">epidermis</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermis" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">dermis</a>.</li>
      <li>This scavenging ability contributes to the restoration of skin elasticity and a reduction in wrinkle depth.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
<strong>Inhibition of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS):</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Excessive accumulation of ROS from repeated UV exposures and intrinsic aging can lead to inflammatory responses. ASX helps suppress the activation of ROS-producing enzymes and xanthine oxidase (an enzyme found in many species, including humans, and primarily functions in the catabolism of purine nucleic acids) in UV-irradiated cells.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
<strong>Regulation of Inflammatory Cytokines and MMPs:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>ASX helps modulate inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α) (same as resveratrol mentioned before) released due to UV exposure and intrinsic aging.</li>
      <li>This modulation helps inhibit the upregulation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">matrix metalloproteinases</a> (MMPs: MMPs, can degrade collagen and elastic fibers, leading to wrinkles and loss of skin elasticity.), including MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-9.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
<strong>Maintenance of Skin Barrier Integrity:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>ASX supports skin barrier integrity by inhibiting excessive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corneocyte" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">corneocyte</a> desquamation, maintaining the epidermal barrier functions.</li>
      <li>It decreases plasma oxidation-related <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malondialdehyde" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">malondialdehyde</a> (MDA) concentration, contributing to overall skin health.</li>
    </ul>

<p>Vitamin D is a lipid-soluble <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohormone" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">prohormone</a> that is vital for the maintenance of bone and muscle health by promoting the absorption and metabolism of calcium and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">phosphate</a>. <a href="#16">[16]</a> In addition to food sources such as fatty fish, eggs, fortified milk and cod liver oil, the human body uses ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation from sunlight to synthesise a significant portion of vitamin D requirements.</p>

<p>The figure below is from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DP9RHWgNZ2U&amp;ab_channel=CatalystUniversity" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Catalyst University</a>, which shows the process of biosynthesis of Vitamin D.</p>

</p>

<p>Starting from the up-left of the graph above, the synthesis of vitamin D starts with the oxidation of cholesterol to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7-Dehydrocholesterol" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">7-dehydrocholesterol</a> (7-DHC). (7-dehydrocholesterol is part of the metabolic pathway that controls the synthesis of cholesterol in human cells.) 7-DHC is then transported to the skin and is stored in the cell membranes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratinocyte" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">keratinocytes</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">fibroblasts</a> in the epidermis of skin. <a href="#16">[16]</a> In the skin, 7-DHC is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photodissociation" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">photolysed</a> by UVB (290–315 nm) to previtamin $D_3$, which is converted to <strong>inactive</strong> vitamin D (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecalciferol" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Cholecalciferol</a>) by photolysis-mediated thermo-isomerisation. (<a href="https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/107505/what-is-thermal-isomerization" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">What is thermal isomerization?</a>)</p>

<p>To become biologically <strong>active</strong>, the vitamin D originating from dermal production or dietary sources undergoes a series of enzymatic conversions in the liver and kidney.

<p>Electrolytes such as sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium are physiologically important due to their integral roles in metabolic and biologic processes. <a href="#21">[21]</a> Magnesium (${Mg}^{2+}$) possesses two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvation_shell" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">hydration shells</a>, making its hydrated radius larger than that of other cations (${Na}^+$, $K^+$, and ${Ca}^{2+}$).</p>

<p>The ‘hydrated radius’ is the effective size of the ion when surrounded by water molecules. In the case of magnesium, it has two layers or shells of water molecules around it. Because magnesium has two hydration shells, the presence of these water layers makes the effective size or radius of the hydrated magnesium ion larger compared to other cations (positively charged ions).</p>

<p>Magnesium is an essential mineral which is a cofactor in over 300 enzymatic reactions for protein synthesis such as muscle contraction, nerve function, blood pressure and hormone binding. <a href="#22">[22]</a>. Magnesium is required for energy production, oxidative phosphorylation, and glycolysis. It contributes to the structural development of bone and is required for the synthesis of DNA, RNA, and the antioxidant glutathione. Magnesium also plays a role in the active transport of calcium and potassium ions across cell membranes, a process that is important to nerve impulse conduction, muscle contraction, and normal heart rhythm. <a href="#23">[23]</a></p>

<p>As we discussed in the Vitamin D section,  vitamin D can’t work without first being converted into a form your body can absorb. The level to which a vitamin or mineral can be absorbed is known as its “bioavailability.” Vitamin D’s bioavailability depends on magnesium. The enzymes (in the liver and kidneys) that enable vitamin D metabolism—converting it into its active form, calcitriol — can’t work without sufficient amounts of magnesium to draw upon.</p>

<p>Early signs of magnesium deficiency include loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and weakness. Therefore proper intake of magnesium from food or supplements is important. Magnesium supplements are available in a variety of forms. The following information comes from Dr. Jin W. Sung. ‘s YouTube Channel <a href="#23">[23]</a>.</p>

<h2 id="suggest-doses-summary-and-concerns-">Suggest Doses, Summary and Concerns <a name="summary_and_concerns"></a>
</h2>

<p>Supplements come in various forms, and understanding their safe levels is crucial. The following is a brief corresponding supplement suggested dosage based on Observed Safe Level (OSL) of human body.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
<strong>NMN (Nicotinamide Mononucleotide):</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>NMN products, popular for anti-aging, are available in high doses (e.g., 500 mg).</li>
